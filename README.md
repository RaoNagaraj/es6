# es6
A list of ES6 / Harmony / ES2015 features, tips, tools and resources. Standardization and implementation might take a while to reach the point where ECMAScript6 is widely adopted by developers - that being said, it's wise to adopt today what we'll see tomorrow especially with the amount of syntatic features being added to this spec.

## History
* ECMAScript is now 17 years old with it's birth in 1997 
  * ECMAScript is the standard. `JavaScript`, `ActionScript` and `JScript` are implementations of it.

## ES6 Introduction
