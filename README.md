## History
ECMAScript is now 17 years old with it's birth in 1997 - you may know it from multiple well know implementations known as JavaScript, JScript and ActionScript. The language was invented by Brendan Eich at Netscape and first appeared in that companyâ€™s Navigator 2.0 browser. It has appeared in all subsequent browsers from Netscape and in all browsers from Microsoft starting with Internet Explorer 3.0. 

A brief snapshot of it's history:
